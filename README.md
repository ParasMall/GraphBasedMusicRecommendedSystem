# # 🎵 Graph-Based Music Recommendation System

A backend music recommendation engine that uses graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's to suggest songs based on user preferences such as mood, genre, or song similarity.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course to implement and analyze classical graph algorithms in a real-world scenario. The goal is to simulate how music platforms recommend songs based on inter-song relationships.

## 👨‍💻 Team Members

- **Paras Mall** – Backend Integration and Testing  
- **Mani Dhiman** – Graph Algorithm Design and Optimization  
- **Ashutosh Saklani** – Data Structures and Logic Implementation  
- **Annant Parashar** – Input Handling and Dataset Management

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Recommends songs based on:
  - Selected song
  - Genre or mood
  - Listening history
- 📊 Uses graph-based search for efficient recommendations
- 🧠 Implements BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s algorithm
- 🔗 Song metadata and similarity represented using custom graphs

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – To find songs within a similar range.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – To explore deeper connections in the song graph.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – To calculate the most relevant song suggestions using weighted graphs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++  
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, Hash Maps, Linked Lists  
- **Input/Output**: File-based user history and song metadata
